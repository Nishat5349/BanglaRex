# Bangla-REX: A Distinct Dataset for Bangla Relation Extraction
Bangla REX (Bangla Relation Extraction) introduces an innovative dataset designed meticulously for relation extraction tasks in Bangla, addressing critical shortcomings in existing resources. This initiative aims to bridge significant gaps in supporting advanced methodologies for relation extraction. The paper presents a comprehensive corpus comprising 90,441 text entries in both raw and formatted formats. Additionally, we have curated a Bangla Knowledge Base (KB) containing 63,256 entries to automate the tagging process with relation labels for the corpus. 

The English translations of the Bangla data are stored in a separate file. To expedite the translation process, we utilized Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/) alongside our dataset.
